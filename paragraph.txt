The solar system is similar to a large family in space. At its center, you will find the Sun, acting as the parent, providing us with light and heat. Orbiting the Sun, there are eight planets, and Earth is our home among them. These planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are like our cosmic siblings, each having its own unique characteristics. Some are extremely hot, while others are exceptionally cold. Encircling these planets, there are numerous small objects called moons, much like our Moon orbiting Earth. The solar system serves as an enormous playground where these celestial objects revolve around the Sun, making it an exciting place for exploration and discovery!
